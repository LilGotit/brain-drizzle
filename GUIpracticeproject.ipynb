The good news is that my professor sent me a myriad of resources and recommendations on creating my first GUI program. Even if it's some basic calculation, I'd like to watch the videos he has recommended, and give tkinter a shot. That will be much of my work for today, on this end."

Whether it's simple math, sight words, or something else...I would like for him to be able to use it. He will be the audience. Education will be the goal."

To really get some depth, I'll get feedback from my son, and figure out how to address his criticisms. A fun exercise on a process, layered on top of an educational goal, layered upon a purpose to practice."
